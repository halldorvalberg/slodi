## Vision

The project’s mission is to support scout leaders by providing tools that make program planning simpler, smarter, and more collaborative. By storing activities, enabling structured program creation, and providing insights into program diversity, Slóði ensures every scout benefits from a rich and varied experience.

## Main Features

### Activity Library

A central collection of scouting activities with clear instructions, age suitability, required materials, time estimates, and tips from other leaders.

### Program Builder

A drag-and-drop tool for assembling full programs (meetings, weekends, or camps) from activities. Programs can be organized by time, theme, or patrol.

### Templates and Examples

Pre-built templates for common scouting events such as weekly meetings, badge programs, and camps. Leaders can use them directly or customize them to fit their needs.

### Collaboration Tools

The ability to share programs and activities with other leaders, patrols, or units. Includes support for comments, suggestions, and reuse of shared plans.

### Search and Tags

A robust search function with tags and filters, enabling leaders to find activities by age group, difficulty, location, materials, or theme.

### Program Analysis Tool

A tool for reviewing past events and analyzing program diversity. Helps leaders ensure scouts experience a balanced mix of activities, such as outdoor adventure, creativity, teamwork, and reflection.
