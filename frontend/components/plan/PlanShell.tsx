/**
 * Vinnubekkurinn — the plan route (A1, sc-34), laid out as the v5 hi-fi.
 *
 * ## Why the shell is a three-track frame, not a page
 *
 * The design is an application window, not a document: a masthead across the
 * top, the dagskrárbankinn pinned on the left, and one scrolling canvas in the
 * middle that swaps between the three views. That shape is load-bearing rather
 * than cosmetic — assembling a fundur means moving blocks *from* the bank *to*
 * the bench, and a rail that scrolls away with the page cannot be a source you
 * drag from. So the frame owns the viewport height and only `.cv` scrolls.
 *
 * ## One dataset, three views
 *
 * ADR-002 §2 requires the grid (A2) and the month calendar (A4) to be renderings
 * of one dataset rather than separate tools, so they mount inside this shell and
 * read the same `usePlan` query. The bench reads its own fundir — a different
 * shape for a different question, see `plan.service.ts` — but the same season.
